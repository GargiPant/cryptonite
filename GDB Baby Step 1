#  GDB Baby Step 1

## Description 

Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## Approach 

This challenge is an executable file and our task is to do Reverse Engineering on it using GDB and find out the value contained in the EAX register at the end of the main function.

We check the content of the directory by ls command


We check the file type of debugger0_a. We find its a ELF file, 64 bit Executable and not stripped
